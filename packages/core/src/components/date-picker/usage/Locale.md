The locale for the date picker is specified by the `locale` prop, which takes a language-sensitive string representation of the date. Reference the two-letter language and country codes, defined by [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) and [ISO-3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1). This example is set to Farsi/Iran.
